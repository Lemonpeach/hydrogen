# hydrogen

Don't waste your time writing redux and react boilerplate.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lemonpeach/hydrogen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lemonpeach/hydrogen)

## Overview

Provides a suite of pluggable redux and react tools that aim to remove boilerplate through a set of minimal conventions.

## Packages

| package  | description  |
|---|---|
| [redux-hydrogen](packages/redux-hydrogen/README.md)  | A pluggable service layer that conventionalizes reducers, actions, and selectors. |
| [react-redux-hydrogen](packages/react-redux-hydrogen/README.md) | A set of HOCs that connect your components to state generated by `redux-hydrogen`. |
| [redux-hydrogen-feathers](packages/redux-hydrogen-feathers/README.md) | A [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/) request adapter for `redux-hydrogen`.  |

## Example

The following is a non-exhaustive example of what is possible when using Hydrogen's suite of tools.

In this example:

- We have a REST endpoint that stores `tag` data.
  - A tag has a name and a date representing when it was created.
  - The `tags` endpoint exists at `${host}/tags` and our [FeathersJS client](https://github.com/feathersjs/client) is set up for us already.
- We want to build a component to list all `tags` created today, as well as a button that will add a new tag with a random name.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D @hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen @hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen-feathers @hydrogenjs/react-redux-hydrogen
```

### Set Up

```js
// hydrogen.js
import createHydrogen from '@hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen'
import feathersHydrogen from '@hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen-feathers'
import create from '@hydrogenjs/react-redux-hydrogen'

import client from './my-feathers-client'

const hydrogen = createHydrogen({ adapter: feathersHydrogen(client) })
const hydrogenize = create(hydrogen)

const { useFind, userFirst, useGet } = hydrogenize

export {
  useFind,
  userFirst,
  useGet,
  hydrogen
}
```

```js
// store.js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { reducer } from '@hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen'

const combinedReducers = combineReducers({
  hydrogen: reducer // it must be mounted under 'hydrogen'
})

export const store = createStore(combinedReducers)
```

### Usage

```js
// my-component.js
import React from 'react'
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import moment from 'moment'
import sillyname from 'sillyname'

import { useFind, hydrogen } from './hydrogen'

const createTag = hydrogen.service('tags').create

const Tags = ({ createTag, tags }) => {
  const tags = useFind('tags', {
    query: { $gt: moment.startOf('day').format() }
  })
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <button
        onClick={e => {
          e.preventDefault()
          createTag({
            name: sillyname(),
            date: moment.format()
          })(dispatch)
        }}
      />
      {
        tags.map(t => (
          <Fragment>
            <span>{t.name}</span>
            <span>{t.date}</span>
          </Fragment>
        ))
      }
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

### Explanation

1. The `useFind` hook from `react-redux-hydrogen` will load all `tags` where their date is greater than 12 am today.
2. A create thunk is instantiated from `redux-hydrogen`, for the `tags` service, to
take care of making requests to the back-end and inserting into local `redux` state.

The `useFind` hook will load the `tags` resource into your component. It does this by attempting to select it from local `redux` state, and if not found, it will make a request through your configured request adapter to retrieve the data. It applies any query given to it to both filter the local state and as a query parameter to your backend.

In the background `redux-hydrogen` is managing the reducers, actions, and selectors that `react-redux-hydrogen` is using to load the `tags` resource.

**No other code** is required to manage your `tag` data through `redux` in your application.
