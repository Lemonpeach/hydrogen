The most basic installation  needs `redux-hydrogen` and `redux-thunk`. You can use this in any framework that is compatible with Redux.

```bash
npm install @hydrogenjs/redux-hydrogen redux-thunk
```

## Complementary packages

Hydrogen is a pluggable ecosystem, and as such, there are a number of other packages that enable integration with `redux-hydrogen` and other frameworks.

To install any of the listed packages simply replace the package name in the follwing command with the name of the package.

```bash
npm install @hydrogenjs/${package-name}
```
